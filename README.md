# Personality Test


## Description

Ever dream of being a rea-life D&D character? Well now's your chance! This project will ask you a series of questions, and compile your answers into 100% ACCURATE RESULTS*! Now you too can slay dragons!

* Totally accurate. For reals. We're not lying.

**statcalc.html** is a flat file which takes test answers and sends them to statgraph.html to be processed as values.


## Configuration & Usage

This project is really only good for sending data UNSECURED between html pages, and I guess neat CSS animations. If you have any real use for these things, they're all yours.
